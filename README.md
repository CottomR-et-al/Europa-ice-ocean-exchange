Hello!

Disclaimers: This is the first code I've uploaded to my GitHub as a grad student. 
I apologize—this notebook is a mess! I hope to clean it up soon. 

In general, this code models key mechanical aspects of fluid's ascent via blade-like, planar fractures through the Europan ice shell.

This code is tied to a recent Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC) abstract of mine (2026), and may be relevant to an upcoming paper.

Thank you for reading this short description.
