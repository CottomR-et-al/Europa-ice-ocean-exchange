# Europan Ice Shell Dikes

Hello!

My first GitHub repo!

In general, this code models key mechanical aspects of fluid's ascent via blade-like, planar fractures through the Europan ice shell.

This code is tied to a recent my Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC) abstract (Spring 2026), and may be relevant to an upcoming paper.

Thank you for reading this short description.
